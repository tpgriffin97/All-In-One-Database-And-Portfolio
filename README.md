# Griffin-Point-of-Sale-System (UPDATED 8/28)
Primarily me learning how to use sqlite3, but could bloom into a more full-fledged project.

# Database Management Goals
1) Create a relational database that stores customer information, sales data, number of transactions on a particular type of transaction.
2) Return a readable, formatted file within a custom GUI - the data will be pulled from the other databases and formatted accordingly.
3) Custom GUI to take data, insert into databases using sqlite3. Store data on local hardware.

# Minimal viable product
The MVP should act a lot like a typical register system you would see at most establishments. Visual-aid needed to elaborate further.
