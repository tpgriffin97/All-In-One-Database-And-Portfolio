# Griffin-Point-of-Sale-System (UPDATED 9/5)
Primarily me learning how to use sqlite3, but could bloom into a more full-fledged project.

# Current Progress & Developer Updates
At this time I am pressing myself to learn Sqlite better than I already do. It's a process with what little time I have to develop, but as of now my progress is as follows:
- Relearned basic syntax for SQL
- Building functions for individual databases & importing those into my main application
- Reviewed how to manage & visualize tables & datasets
- Currently studying best database management practices
- Reviewing classes, decorators, and functions.

My next few steps are to integrate the skills I have become acquainted with to implement a database that store user input into a server - which for the moment will simply be me storing dummy-users into my local system - then pushing myself to create a website utilizing Flask & Django. 

I feel confident I can have a working system in the near future. Until then, I will keep posting here to motivate myself.



# Database Management Goals
1) Create a relational database that stores customer information, sales data, number of transactions on a particular type of transaction.
2) Return a readable, formatted file within a custom GUI - the data will be pulled from the other databases and formatted accordingly.
3) Custom GUI to take data, insert into databases using sqlite3. Store data on local hardware.

# Minimal viable product
The MVP should act a lot like a typical register system you would see at most establishments. Visual-aid needed to elaborate further.

# GUI Design Using Tkinter
As of late, I have taught myself the basics of using Tkinter using a combination of googling and Realpython.com. My goal was to increase my productivity by utlizing more visual interfaces (as I am a visual learner), while also teaching myself how to attach functionality to buttons, form entries, and utlizing different types of geometry managers. As of now, I believe this will be a big step forward in bringing my project to life. More updates to come soon!
