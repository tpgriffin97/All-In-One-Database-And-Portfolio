# Griffin-Point-of-Sale-System (UPDATED 9/6)
Primarily me learning how to use sqlite3, but could bloom into a more full-fledged project.

# Current Progress & Developer Updates
At this time I am pressing myself to learn Sqlite better than I already do. It's a process with what little time I have to develop, but as of now my progress is as follows:
- Relearned basic syntax for SQL
- Building functions for individual databases & importing those into my main application
- Reviewed how to manage & visualize tables & datasets
- Currently studying best database management practices
- Reviewing classes, decorators, and functions.

Tkinter Framework Updates:
- Learned the basic 5 widgets(label, text, entry, frame, button)
- Learned types of geo management(pack(), grid(), place())
- Binding functions to widgets & and updating GUI accordingly (binding, bind())
- Grid management and general design principles of readability
- Event and Error Handling understandings have improved due to visual feedback

While learning to use Sqlite, I ran into some issues. Namely, how do I create an interface for the user to interact with. One that is reactive to your input, and that can interact with the backend databases? One solution I had in mind was using Django & Flask to create a website with a responsive design, but that would reuqire I learn webhosting. At this time, I do not have the resources to put towards the development. 

# Database Management Goals (UPDATED 9/6)
1) Create a relational database that stores customer information, sales data, number of transactions on a particular type of transaction. [ ]
2) Return a readable, formatted file within a custom GUI - the data will be pulled from the other databases and formatted accordingly.[ ] 
3) Custom GUI to take data, insert into databases using sqlite3. Store data on local hardware. [ ]
4) Develop familiarity with Tkinter framework & custom GUI designs [ ]

# Minimal viable product (UPDATED 9/6)
My previous MVP was closer to a register system, but I decided that wasn't fun enough. I brainstormed for a while, and now I think an app that tracks the movies, books, and games I own would be more fun & useful. It will act a lot like Letterbox or Backlog, but it's an exercise for myself. I will see if this idea holds water over the coming weeks.

# GUI Design Using Tkinter (UPDATED 9/6)
As of late, I have taught myself the basics of using Tkinter using a combination of googling and Realpython.com. My goal was to increase my productivity by utlizing more visual interfaces (as I am a visual learner), while also teaching myself how to attach functionality to buttons, form entries, and utlizing different types of geometry managers. As of now, I believe this will be a big step forward in bringing my project to life. More updates to come soon!
