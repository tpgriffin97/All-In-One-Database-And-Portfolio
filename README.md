# All-in-One Database and Portfolio
SOme major updates have been added, as well as some general cleaning up. I have updated the main branch with the latest version. Thinking back, I wouldn't update this frequest until a feature is fully implemented, but showing my progress has been a major motivating factor. 


# Current Progress & Developer Updates
At this time I am pressing myself to learn Sqlite better than I already do. It's a process with what little time I have to develop, but as of now my progress is as follows:
- Implemented working entry fields that stores data in database
- Utilized DB Browser to manage the database with a clear interface
- Deleted some less-than-needed buttons, while keeping a few for later development
- Created working data-to-graph pipeline (simply click the first name button) utlizing matplotlib
- All graphs can be downloaded as .pngs
- Display database datapoints in the user info section
- Working update, delete, and submit buttons for database
- Implemented working messageboxes for testing purposes


Tkinter/GUI:
- Learned the basic 5 widgets(label, text, entry, frame, button)
- Learned types of geo management(pack(), grid(), place())
- Binding functions to widgets & and updating GUI accordingly (binding, bind())
- Grid management and general design principles of readability
- Event and Error Handling understandings have improved due to visual feedback
- Visual clarity


# Project Goals
In-Progress
1) ~Query database and graph the salaries of users and their age~ [X]
2) Accept CSV files into database and organize them accordingly [ ]
3) Create fuller, richer UI thats larger and more intuitive [ ]
4) Implement better, more pythonic code to include more complex functions & classes [ ]
5) Compact the "busy" code blocks into their own classes and functions (if possible) [ ]
6) Implement more datbases that interact with other databases [ ]
7) Create Python Unittests to become more comfortable in program development [ ]


Completed Goals
- ~Create a relational database that stores basic user information~ [X]
- ~Return a readable, formatted file within a custom GUI - the data will be pulled from the other databases and formatted accordingly.~[X] 
- ~Custom GUI to take data, insert into databases using sqlite3. Store data on local hardware.~ [X]
- ~Develop familiarity with Tkinter framework & custom GUI designs~ [X]
- ~Iterate by addition of multiple mini-projects previously completed~ [X]
- ~Create a clean, but simple interface that houses differing types of functions, windows.~ [X]


# Minimal viable product
The main goal is to create a flexible database entry system that can be used by anyone. Simply insert your CSV files, then select how you wish to graph them!
